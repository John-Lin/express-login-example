# express-login-example

This is a user authentication demonstration web app build with ExpressJS and MongoDB. It is modified for my personal favor and heavily borrowed from [passport-local-express4](https://github.com/mjhea0/passport-local-express4).

In this simple web app provided:

1. Login / Logout

2. Registering a user account


The original tutorial check out the blog post [User Authentication With Passport and Express 4](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4/)
